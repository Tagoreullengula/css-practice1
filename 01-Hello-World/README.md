# `01` Hello World in CSS

CSS is about styles. To apply styles you always have to follow these steps:

1. Read the HTML and pick what element you want to decorate or apply styles to.

2. Programmatically select the element you want to style using CSS Selectors.

3. Write the styling that you want by using CSS rules.

That is it! The rest is just semantics! 😁

Look at this example:

```html
<style>
    a {
        color: pink;
    }
</style>
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Click me to open google.com</a>
```

We have an HTML anchor `<a>` that takes people to google.com when clicked.
We use CSS to select all the anchor tags and make them pink.
